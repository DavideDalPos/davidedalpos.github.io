<b>Abstract:</b> <i>A catalogue of the species of Platylabini from the south-eastern United States is presented, with an updated list of the species, a review of their distribution, and the first illustrated key to the genera and species.</i> Cyclolabus gracilicornis gracilicornis <i>(Provancher, 1886) is
newly recorded for the province of Nova Scotia (Canada), while eight
species are recorded for the first time for the following US states:
</i> Amboplisus ornatus <i>(Cresson, 1868) for Georgia; </i>Asthenolabus canadensis<i>
(Cresson, 1877) for West Virginia; </i>Linycus exhortator thoracicus
<i>(Cresson, 1864) for Virginia, </i>Neolinycus michaelis <i>Heinrich, 1971 for Florida; </i>Platylabus clarus <i>(Cresson, 1867) for Alabama, Virginia and West Virginia; </i>Platylabus opaculus americanus <i>Heinrich, 1962 for North Carolina; </i>Probolus detritus <i>(Brullé, 1846) and </i>Tropicolabus foxi <i>(Davis, 1898) for Florida. Based on newly discovered and already published material, a new subspecies synonym has been recognised: </i>Neolinycus michaelis arkansae <i>Heinrich 1975 is regarded as a junior synonym of </i>Neolinycus michaelis michaelis <i>Heinrich, 1971, and the previous subspecies synonymy that regarded </i>Neolinycus michaelis georgianus <i>Heinrich, 1972 as a junior synonym of the nominate subspecies has been confirmed and explained. The female of </i>Tropicolabus foxi <i>is described for the first time, marking the first record of the species since its original description. Nomenclatural notes and extensive comments for each species are provided, as well as a key to the tribes of Ichneumoninae of North America, and to the genera and species of Platylabini from the south-eastern United States.</i>.
