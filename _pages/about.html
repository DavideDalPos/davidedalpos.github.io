<h1 class="underlined-heading">About</h1>


<p>
  I am an Italian entomologist interested in insect diversity, morphology, and evolution of parasitoid wasps, esepcially in the family Ichneumonidae (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonoidea).
  My fascination with these extraordinary creatures stems from their unique morphology, and a desire to uncover how they evolve and adapt to the various ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
  I completed my Master’s degree in Natural Sciences at the <b>University of Padua</b>, where I focused my research on Ichneumonid wasps as bioindicators.
  Currently, I’m pursuing my Ph.D. in <i>Integrative and Conservation Biology</i> at the <b>University of Central Florida (UCF)</b>, under the mentorship of Dr. Barbara Sharanowski. 
  My research is centered on the evolution of multiple traits (syndrome) in response to the same environmental pressure in the famile Ichneumonidae.
</p>
<p>
  In my free time, I am also a taxonomist, interested in enhancing our knowledge of the subfamily Ichneumoninae. 
  I am actively describing several new species and working to improve the classification and understanding of this diverse group of wasps. 
</p>
<p>
 Currently, I am the president of the <b>Center for Systematic Entomology (CSE)</b> and I serve as an editorial board member for <i>Insecta Mundi</i>.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to my research, I am dedicated to teaching and mentoring the next generation of scientists. I was honored by UCF for excellence in graduate teaching LINK.  
  I would love to continue my research as a postdoctoral scholar, deepening our understanding of insect evolution while mentoring others who share my passion for discovery.
