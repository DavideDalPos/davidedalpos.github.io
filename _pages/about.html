<p>
  I am an Italian entomologist interested in insect diversity, morphology, and evolution, particularly in parasitoid wasps.
  My fascination with these extraordinary creatures stems from their unique morphology, and a desire to explore how they evolve and adapt to the various ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
  I completed my Master’s degree in Natural Sciences at the <b>University of Padua</b>, where I focused my research on Ichneumonid wasps as bioindicators.
  Currently, I’m pursuing my Ph.D. in Integrative and Conservation Biology at the University of Central Florida (UCF), under the mentorship of Dr. Barbara Sharanowski. 
  My research is centered on the morphological evolution of parasitoid wasps, specifically the family Ichneumonidae, or Darwin wasps. 
  Through my work, I aim to shed light on the evolutionary forces that shape these wasps and their unique relationship with their hosts.
</p>
<p>
  Taxonomy is a key focus of my work. I’m particularly interested in enhancing our knowledge of Ichneumoninae, a subfamily within Ichneumonidae. 
  I am actively describing several new species and working to improve the classification and understanding of this diverse group of wasps. 
  My work has taken me to various parts of the world, from the forests of South America to field sites across the United States, 
  always in search of new insights into these remarkable insects.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout my academic journey, I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with and learn from leading entomologists and taxonomists. 
  These collaborations have been essential in shaping my approach to science, and I’m passionate about giving back to the scientific community through my roles 
  as vice president of the Center for Systematic Entomology and as an editorial board member for <i>Insecta Mundi</i>.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to my research, I’m dedicated to teaching and mentoring the next generation of scientists. I was honored by UCF for excellence in graduate teaching, 
  and I take pride in helping students navigate complex material with confidence. After completing my Ph.D. in 2024, 
  I plan to continue my research as a postdoctoral scholar, deepening our understanding of insect evolution while mentoring others who share my passion for discovery.
