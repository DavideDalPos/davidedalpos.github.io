<p>
  I am an entomologist interested in insect diversity, morphology, taxonomy and evolution of parasitoid wasps, especially of the family Ichneumonidae (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonoidea).
</p>
<p>
  I completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Natural Sciences at the <b>University of Padua</b>, where I focused my research on Ichneumonid wasps as bioindicators.
  Currently, I am a Ph.D. candiddate in <i>Integrative and Conservation Biology</i> at the <b>University of Central Florida (UCF)</b>, in the <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/sharanowski-lab/" target="_blank">
    Sharanowski Lab</a>, where I am exploring the role of syndrome (multitrait evolution) in shaping the morphological evolution of Ichneumonidae.
</p>
<p>
  My interesets are broad, ranging from evolution, taxonomy, databasing, cataloging, and comparative anatomy of parasitoid wasps. Taxonomically, my expertise revolves around the subfamily Ichnuemoninae, 
  actively describing new species (when I have time). Check the full list of taxa I described under <a href="research" target="_blank">Research</a>.
</p>
<p>
 I am also active in the overall broader entomological community, currently serving as president of the <a href="https://centerforsystematicentomology.org/default.asp?action=show_home" target="_blank">
  Center for Systematic Entomology (CSE)</a> and as an editorial board member for the open-access journal <a href="https://centerforsystematicentomology.org/default.asp?action=insectamundi" target="_blank"><i>Insecta Mundi</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to my research, I am dedicated to teaching and mentoring the next generation of scientists, and due to my efforts as a Teaching Assistant at UCF, I was the recipient of the 
  <i>College of Sciences Award for Excellence by a Graduate Teaching Assistant</i> and the <i>University Award for Excellence by a Graduate Teaching Assistant</i>. 
  You can read the full story <a href="https://graduate.ucf.edu/profile/davide-dal-pos" target="_blank">here</a>.  
  I would love to continue my research as a postdoctoral scholar, deepening our understanding of insect evolution while mentoring others who share my passion for discovery.
