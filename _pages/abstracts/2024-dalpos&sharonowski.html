    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>The evolution of convergent phenotypes is of major interest in biology because of their omnipresence
        and ability to inform the study of evolutionary novelty and constraint. Convergent
        phenotypes can be combinations of traits that evolve concertedly, called syndromes, and
        these can be shaped by a common environmental pressure. Parasitoid wasps which use a
        wide variety of arthropod hosts have also repeatedly and convergently switched host use
        across their evolutionary history. They thus represent a natural laboratory for the evolution
        of trait syndromes that are associated with parasitism of specific hosts and host substrates.
        In this study, we tested the evolution of co-evolving characters in the highly diverse family
        Ichneumonidae associated with ovipositing in a specific and well-defined substrate: wood.
        Using a newly constructed phylogeny and an existing morphological dataset, we identified
        six traits correlated with the wood-boring lifestyle that demonstrate convergent evolution. At
        least one trait, the presence of teeth on the ovipositor, typically preceded the evolution of
        other traits and possibly the switch to parasitism of wood-boring hosts. For each trait, we
        provide a historical review of their associations with wood-boring parasitoids, reevaluate the
        function of some characters, and suggest future coding improvements. Overall, we demonstrate
        the convergent evolution of multiple traits associated with parasitism of woodboring
        hosts and propose a syndrome in a hyper diverse lineage of parasitoid wasps.</p>
